Create an arduino iot cloud account: https://cloud.arduino.cc

Download cloud agent: https://cloud.arduino.cc/download-agent/

Wire your module based on image

Create a thing and add a device
  It is a ESP32 Wroover Module
  Add wifi credentials and save your secret key

Add all the cloud variables from the image
  All the sensors should be read only while everything else is read/write

Connect ESP to your device

Paste code into the code section and go to thing_properties.h and type your internet details and secret key 

Create a dashboard and add 2 gauges (temp and smoke) and 1 percent widget (humidity) and set them to their respective variable

If you would like to track and store all the data you have collected create a graph and set to the variables

Create twillo phone number (free; you get free credits to use instead of real money)

  Go to https://www.twilio.com and create an account.

  If you are on a trial account:

    You must verify every phone number you send calls or texts to.

    This is a legal restriction; only paid accounts can call any number without verifying.

In your Twilio Console:

  Copy down:

    Account SID (looks like ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)

    Auth Token (keep this private)

Go to Phone Numbers → Manage → Buy a Number.

  Get a Toll-Free or Local number that supports voice calls.

  If you use a toll-free number, Twilio requires toll-free verification before it can send messages/calls reliably — you’ll fill out their form.

In Twilio Console:

Go to Functions → TwiML Bins → Create New TwiML Bin.

Paste something like this: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say voice="alice">Warning! The habitat monitoring system has detected an alert. Please check your system immediately.</Say>
</Response>

Save it and copy the TwiML Bin URL (it will look like https://handler.twilio.com/twiml/EHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).
